White nights waited for me
Over the expanse of dense islands ...
Familiar eyes are looking again,
And the past flashes without words.

I donâ€™t believe in the kingdom of time,
I still keep the strength of the heart,
I will not hide the fatal loss
But I can't say forever.

With the long sunset twinkling
Before a minute nap of the day
That his light died without return,
You cannot assure me this night.
